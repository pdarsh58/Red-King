Difficulties I had in making the game

I was creating game for the very first time, so everything was new for me.
The videos on the cs50x doesnâ€™t explains many codes, so sometime I had look up and watch several videos to know about a single function, and it took so much of my but the good things I learned a lot from that.
When I was creating game my functions would not work as I wanted, I literally spent hours and hours to figure out how to write the right coordinates that would do the job.
And particular I wanted to include the mario pyramid in my game which was not easy at all to and it took so many trails to set the pyramid where I wanted.

What I learned

I learned how to use love2d to build games and how to use lua files
Also, I learned to build cool games like mario,
Also, I kind learned how to debug hard errors.
